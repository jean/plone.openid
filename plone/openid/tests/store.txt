Introduction
============

Lets start by importing some modules we will be using:

  >>> from plone.openid.store import ZopeStore
  >>> from openid.association import Association
  >>> import time

Next we create a store object:

  >>> store = ZopeStore()


Associations
============

Lets create a new association:

  >>> now = int(time.time())
  >>> a = Association(handle="handle", secret="secret", issued=now,
  ...                 lifetime=600, assoc_type="HMAC-SHA1")

We can store the association and retrieve it via a server_url and its handle:

  >>> store.storeAssociation("http://localhost", a)
  >>> b = store.getAssociation("http://localhost", "handle")
  >>> a == b
  True

If we ask for an association with a None handle the store should still
return an assocation for the server:

  >>> b = store.getAssociation("http://localhost", None)
  >>> a == b
  True

Trying to retrieve a non-existing association should return None:

  >>> store.getAssociation("http://nothere") is None
  True
  >>> store.getAssociation("http://localhost", "nothere") is None
  True

Associations can be removed based on their server_url and handle. The
return value for removeAssociation indicates if an assocation has been
removed.

  >>> store.removeAssociation("http://localhost", "handle")
  True
  >>> store.removeAssociation("http://localhost", "handle")
  False

In an attempt to clean up expired associations retrieving them will
automatically remove them:

  >>> a = Association(handle="handle", secret="secret", issued=now-10,
  ...                 lifetime=5, assoc_type="HMAC-SHA1")
  >>> store.storeAssociation("http://localhost", a)
  >>> store.cleanupAssociations()
  1

  >>> store.getAssociation("http://localhost", "handle") is None
  True
  >>> store.cleanupAssociations()
  0

Getting an association without specifying a handle should work even
when the current handles are empty.

  >>> store.getAssociation("http://localhost") is None
  True

Nonces
======

OpenId uses nonces, which are basically ids used to track outstanding
requests. A nonce is build up from a server URL and a salt. In order
to be able to track old nonces which may be expired a timestamp is
added to their registration as well.

Using nonces the first time results in a True response

  >>> store.useNonce("one", now, "salt")
  True
  >>> store.useNonce("two", now, "salt")
  True


If we try to add a nonce which already exists False should be returned:

  >>> store.useNonce("two", now, "salt")
  False

Registrations
=============

The OpenID Simple Registration Extension allows the consumer to request
a set of pre-determined fields for the server to return. We ask for all
the possible fields and store the return mapping.

  >>> identity = "http://localhost/someuser"
  >>> registration = {'fullname': 'Some User', 'email': 'some@user.com'}
  >>> persistent_reg = store.storeSimpleRegistration(identity, registration)
  >>> persistent_reg == registration
  True
  >>> store.getSimpleRegistration(identity) == registration
  True
